# Excalidraw RFCs

RFC structure is inspired by [React RFC](https://github.com/reactjs/rfcs) and [Vue RFC](https://github.com/vuejs/rfcs).

The "RFC" (request for comments) process is intended to provide a consistent and controlled path for major features and updates in Excalidraw.

Many changes, including bug fixes, features, and documentation improvements can be implemented and reviewed via the normal GitHub pull request workflow.

Some changes though are "substantial", and we ask that these be put through a bit of a design process and produce a consensus among the Excalidraw core team and the community.
