# Summary

Brief explanation of the feature.

# Basic example

If the proposal involves a new or changed API or impacts the npm package API, include a basic code example.
Omit this section if it's not applicable.

# Motivation

Why are we doing this? What use cases does it support? What is the expected
outcome?

Please focus on explaining the motivation so that if this RFC is not accepted,
the motivation could be used to develop alternative solutions. In other words,
enumerate the constraints you are trying to solve without coupling them too
closely to the solution you have in mind.

# Detailed design

This is the bulk of the RFC. Explain the design in enough detail for somebody
familiar with Excalidraw to understand, and for somebody familiar with the
implementation to implement. This should get into specifics and corner-cases,
and include examples of how the feature is used.
Add examples to explain the approach as well.

# Drawbacks

Why should we _not_ do this? Please consider:

- implementation cost, both in terms of code size and complexity
- whether the proposed feature can be implemented in user space
- the impact on the NPM Package API
- integration of this feature with other existing and planned features
- cost of migrating existing Excalidraw users (is it a breaking change?)

There are tradeoffs to choosing any path. Attempt to identify them here.

# Alternatives

What other designs have been considered? What is the impact of not doing this?

# Adoption strategy

- If we implement this proposal, how will existing Excalidraw users adopt it?
- Is this a breaking change? If yes how are migrating the existing Excalidraw users ?

# Unresolved questions

Optional, but suggested for first drafts. What parts of the design are still
TBD?
